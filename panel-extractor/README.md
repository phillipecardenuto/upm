# Panel Extractor 
In this directory, we present our solution for extracting panels from scientific images.
Our model can delimitate the regions of interest of a scientific images with multiple 
panels. It will simply extract all panels into a output directory, along with a 
csv file that classify each panel within Blots, Graphs, Microscopy, Body Imagery, and
Flow Cytometry images, the most concerned types of panes for scientific integrity.

## Quick Start
We set up a docker image quickly use and reproduce our results.
### 1. Get docker

1.1 Pull from DockerHub:

   ```
   docker pull phillipecardenuto/panel-detection:latest
   ```

1.2 (optional) Build the from Dockerfile
   ```
   ./build.sh
   ```

### 2. Download models:
You may need to install gdown (`pip install gdown`)

	```
	gdown --id 17r4oQelph-iskDarvsznlwEg6qwEJ0R8
	```
### 3. Unzip models:
	```
	unzip panel_extraction_models.zip
	```


### 4. Run Solution using bash script

```
./extract.sh -i <path/to/figure> -o <dirname>
```

Example

```
./extract.sh -o test -i fig1.png fig3.png
```

Arguments

```
[--weights WEIGHTS] (optional)
			Path to new model weight.
			By default the container already uses the weights locate inside the docker.
			There are two weights models inside the docker one addresing a 4 classes output (best of them);
			other addresing the 5 classe output
[--device DEVICE](optional)
		GPU/CPU Device used during (e.g., 0,1; or cpu)
		(Default) cpu
--output-path -o SAVE_PATH (Required):
		Directory name to save the extracted panels.

--input-path -i INPUT_FIGURE(Required):
		Path to Figure. You can input multiple figure at once 
```

# Model training
For training the model, we annotated a dataset of 3,836 figures of which 3,236 figures (32,507 panels) were used for training and  600 figures (4,888 panels) for testing.
The dataset is freely available at this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ahGR_-Kcdux_CpWZi9f-6CTMUkJKsfph/view?usp=sharing).

### Training
For training the model, we fine-tuned yolov5 `yolov5x6.pt` weights on our dataset.
You can run train.py from yolov5 directory to reproduce our experiments.

# Model Testing
To reproduce our results:
1. Download the dataset:
`gdown --id 1ahGR_-Kcdux_CpWZi9f-6CTMUkJKsfph`
2. Unzip dataset:
`unzip panels-extraction-dataset.zip`

3. Initiate a docker container from panel-extractor directory:
```
docker run --rm -it \
    --userns=host \
    --gpus all \
    --shm-size=2gb \
    -v `pwd`:/work \
    phillipecardenuto/panel-detection
```

4. Run the test
```
python test.py --data test.yaml --weights=/work/model_5_class.pt
```
After that, the following metrics should be displayed on your screen.

| Body Imaging     |   600  |   379  |  0.833  |  0.828  |  0.859  |    0.814    |
| Flow Cytometry   |   600  |   249  |  0.948  |  0.976  |  0.973  |    0.953    |
